There is no detailed information available on ecology or population trends for this species. There are potential threats from habitat destruction and pollution, however currently these are not known to be directly affecting this species. It is known to have a relatively narrow distribution (area of occupancy (AOO) estimated to be less than 10,000 km²; extent of occurrence (EOO) less than 25,000 km²), and this almost meets the threshold for VU B1. However, although there are potential threats to the species, it is not known if these are currently affecting the population. There is insufficient information to be able to determine number of locations or whether there is continuing decline. It is therefore assessed as Data Deficient. More research is needed on the threats as this species could be threatened."                                                                                              ,                                         ,                  ,                               ,               ,        ,"This species is reported only from a few streams (in three basins) near Khandala, Igatpuri and Mumbai in the Western Ghats of Maharastra State of India.

The habitat is also very specific, occurring in low salinity region of the backwaters. More research is need to assess the population trends and harvest levels, however it has been harvested for a long time, and it can still be found in large numbers where it occurs. It is therefore assessed as Least Concern.

Although more research is needed on the species and it is believed to occur surrounding areas of Torna, it is expected to be a very restricted range species. The species is very habitat specific living in the spray zones of waterfalls and therefore is suspected to have an area of occupancy of less than 500 km². The major threat to this species is the decline in water flow due to water abstraction and diversion which may be impacting the species specialised habitat. Based on this threats, it is expected that the species occurs in less than five locations.;  The species is assessed as VU D2, based on the potential threats to its habitat. If these threats are found to be causing a decline habitat quality or the population size it would need to be reassessed and placed in a higher threat category. More research is needed on the species and also the need for catchment management to ensure that there is adequate flow in the rivers to sustain the species specialised habitat.

Threats to this species are from pollution and habitat disturbance due to eco-tourism in the water falls. A major threat is water diversion, for agriculture and hydroelectric projects which reduces the flow in rivers and can dry out the waterfalls, leaving no habitat for this species. Most of these waterfalls are found along roadsides, and these are now threatened by plans to widen the highway. It is already thought to have been wiped out of its type locality. The species is therefore assessed as EN as it is found in less than 5 locations, and has an Extent of Occurrence of less than 1,000km2 and an Area of Occupancy of less than 500km2.

Its known range is restricted, and may reach the threshold for a threatened status if more information can be collected about the threats to the species. However, not much information is available on the correct distribution patterns, population structure and in particular, threats to this species, hence it is assessed as Data Deficient category.

Threats to this species are not well known, so the number of locations cannot be identified. It is collected for the aquarium trade, but it is not known what impact this may be having on wild populations. This species is protected in Sri Lanka. As the species has a restricted range, but the impact of the harvesting for the aquarium trade is unknown the species is assessed as Data Deficient. More research is needed on the species threats, as this species could be a threatened.

Pila nevilliana Annandale & Prashad 1921 was not considered a synonym of P. virens by Prashad (1925). Instead, what Prashad wrote was ""... that the species is doubtfully to be placed next to P. virens (Lam)."" K. Hayes (pers. comm. 2010) interprets this to mean he considered it a valid species, but could not fully evaluate its relationship to other Pila species since he did not have fresh material. It is possible that it could be a synonym of P. virens (reported as such by Ramakrishna and Dey 2007), but no one that we are aware of has evaluated these taxa to determine their taxonomic status.

Pollution is a major problem currently facing many freshwater ecosystems across South East Asia (UNEP 1999). The introduction of exotic species of fish into some rivers in Papua New Guinea may also adversely affect freshwater snails, either directly through predation or indirectly by altering benthic ecosystems (Dudgeon and Smith 2006).

In 2009 this species was listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN Pan-Africa Freshwater Biodiversity regional assessment, based upon almost qualifying as Vulnerable under criterion A (population decline). There is the potential of a 20% decline in the species in Africa as a result of major threats within this part of the species range. Residential and recreational development in South Africa, aquaculture in Tanzania (Rufiji River delta) and tractor harvesting for prawns in Mozambique has lead to declines in the quality and extent of habitat. Further threats include Alcoa titanium and dune mining, and sedimentation across southern Africa (IUCN 2010)."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,"1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3, 3.2, 5, 5.4, 5.4.3, 8, 8.1, 8.1.1, 9, 9.1, 9.1.3, 9.2, 9.2.3, 9.3, 9.3.2, 9.3.4",     ,        ,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for this species.

The Mekong River passes through or by China, Myanmar, Lao PDR, Thailand and Cambodia. But since the 1980s the character of the river has been steadily transformed by dam-building programs in Yunnan province in China. Three hydroelectric dams are already in operation and two more are under construction due for completion in 2012 and 2017. Until 2030 there could be plans for at least two more dams. There are also eleven proposed dams on the mainstream of the Mekong below China. Even if no dams are built on the mainstream below China the dams in China will ultimately have serious effects on the functioning of the Mekong. It will alter the hydrology of the river and so the current ‘flood pulse’, the regular rise and fall of the river on an annual basis. The dams will block the flow of sediment down the river which plays a vital part in depositing nutrients on the agricultural regions flooded by the Mekong River. The dams will also lead to the erosion of river banks (Osborne 2009). Although the ecological effects of these dams on freshwater snails are poorly known Temcharoen (1992) mentioned a negative effect on the snails caused by irregular fluctuation of the water level.
Water pollution due to the ongoing industrialisation in those developing countries may also be a threat to the freshwater snails of the Indo-Burma-Region (Temcharoen 1992).","7, 7.2, 7.2.11"                                                                                      ,     ,        ,"Detailed surveys on distribution and research on the biology, population trends of this species are needed.

It is therefore assessed as Least Concern."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,                                         ,                  ,                               ,               ,        ,"Thiara scabra is found throughout Bangladesh, India, Nepal (Gangetic plains), Indonesia (Java), Japan, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myanmar, Thailand, Philippines (Subba Rao 1989, Nesemann et al. 2007,  Ramakrishna and Dey 2007). This species is also listed as present in Oman, South Eastern Arabia (Brown & Gallager 1985). However Feulner and Green (1999) list it as a ‘probably introduced species’ in the UAE (United Arab Emirates).

The species is also recorded from Africa; Tanzania (Zanzibar, Pemba and Tanzania mainland at Wami and Kingani rivers), Kenya and Socotra. It is generally an Indo-Pacific species, including Madagascar and Comoros. The record from Socotra, in rivers up to 500 m; widespread in the Indo Pacific, seems perhaps to be a recent arrival and may be a species in expansion (D. van Damme, pers. comm. 2008) or resulting from accidental introduction.
