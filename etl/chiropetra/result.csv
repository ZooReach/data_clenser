Treated as Meghalaya specimen Harpiocephala mordax (Thomas, 1923).  Specific habitat mentioned for tall trees has to be noted. Mandal et al., 1996. More specimens in collection from Mizoram. No recent sightings.  Das, 1986 reviewed the status of the forms described under genus Harpiocephalus and later Corbet and Hill, 1992 opined that specimens from northeastern India are H. mordax Thomas, 1923.  Thus presently Harpiocepahlus is not considered as monospecific as has been considered by Koopman, 1993 after the consensus of workshop participants.

Sinha 1986 made collections of species other than Hesperoptenus tickelii from Chaibassa, Jharkhand (type locality tickelli - Andersen, 1881).

However, work done by Dr. Yapa didn't find any specimens of this species in Sri Lanka in the past years and hence could be Near Threatened.

The species is found only in Kolar district, Karnataka, India. There has been controversy regarding the systematic position of the species. Identity of the specimens in caves must be clarified. Known from only two localities Hanumanhalli and Therhalli in Karnataka. Current existence of this population is unknown (Srepada). Kolar locality is based upon 2 undated specimens from BM(NH), London. Srinivasulu had been visiting Kolar areas infrequently and the information on habitat is based on informal observations. Kolar and Mysore being 250km apart the group feels that it probably occurs between these two points and nearby areas and calculated the EOO based on 250km on either side. The existing database needs to be corrected with regard to distribution, that is, Thailand; this species is only found in India as described by Kock & Bhatt (1994). Wilson & Reeder (1992) list H. hylophyllus not H. hypophyllus and is not found in Thailand (?). Proper methodology must be applied for counting the number of individuals.

Philips, 1980]. H.l. indus is a valid subspecies in India. It is smaller than its Lankan counterpart.  It is always found with H. speoris, Rhinolophus rouxii, H. fulvus, H. galeritus, Miniopterus schreibersii, Rousettus leishenaulti in Sri Lanka [Yapa & Digana] and H. armiger, Miniopterus schreibersii, Rousettus leishenaulti, Myotis blythii, Rhinolophus pearsonii, Ia io in India [Thabah]. In Mandu a colony of 1000 individuals of this species in 1970s was replaced by Rousettes leschenaulti in 1990s [Bates]. Eonycteris, Megaderma lyra, Taphozous melanopogon [W. Yapa, P.C.M.B. Digana, A. Thabah]. In 1970s there was a large group of H. lankadiva recently it was found to be displaced by Rousettes sp. In Sri Lanka, 11351 bats were counted from various localities [Yapa & Digana]. In Meghalaya there are about 6000 individuals [Tabah]. Considering the population estimates of 16000 both in Sri Lanka and Meghalaya in India an estimate of 20,000 and 10,000 adult mature individuals is a conservative estimate.

Specimens collected from southern Indian localities were initially identified as H. pomona  however Bhat has clarified in his paper (Bhat & Kock, 1994) as H. hypophyllus  The above does not alter the status of the name pomona (Bates).  Stable in area in Myanmar.  It occurs in small groups in each roost.  EOO based on distribution in South Asia only, not Myanmar.

It is a very delicate species, easily affected by slightest disturbance, especially during breeding season.  No special management and conservation plan required.  No decline in habitat and no major threats. In some villages in Tamil Nadu H. speoris is hunted for medicine and food. Population found to be exhibiting maternity colony elsewhere [Sreepada & H.R. Bhat].  Continuous distribution except for population recorded in Dehra Dun (Historical 1874 record).  Roost disturbance affects the species in some parts of southern India.  Sri Lankan population:  EOO >20,000, AOO approx. 1000. Approximately 76 locations.  No decline in habitat and no major threats in Sri Lanka.

At least 2 bats per banana plantation [Madhavan].  It is considered rare because it is difficult to catch in mist nets [Muni].  Mist net is not an appropriate technique for trapping the species.  Harp net technique can be used as in Australia [Hutson]. Banana traders in Sri Lanka come across this species often [Yapa]. Species is very adaptable to change in habitat.  In wild, animals live for 5-6 years.  Life span of microchiropterans in wild is 30 years but most of the individuals die at around 5-6 years due to predation [Hutson & Mistry]. Most individuals die before reaching senility.  Paddy cultivation is replaced by banana plantations in Tamil Nadu, whereas in Kerala banana plantations are converted into housing areas.

The species is found in association with Pteropus giganteus on orchard trees (A.K. Chakravarthy). Distribution restricted to Highwavy & Agastyamalai, Tamil Nadu. As no information on subpopulation exists presently, and the locations from where they have been reported being close, these two locations belong to the same population. If this is true, the locations are contiguous. Bats are captured to serve as food & medicine for local people. However, threats need to be verified. Male:female ratio is 1:2 at High Wavy Mountain Caves [Koilraj]. P.T. Nathan esstimated about 50 individuals from a cave in Periyar Tiger Reserve. Manoi Muni had noticed many bats (about 80-100) fluttering around in 1993. Koilraj tagged 43 individuals from a cave in High Wavy Mountains and estimates that population to be about 80-100.  Given the questionable information used in this evaluation,S. Mistry is uncertain of the final status.  A.K. Chakravarthy and Riki Krishnan identified L. salimalii from Uppinangadi, Mangalore from coastal Karnataka.  If the identification is correct the status might change accordingly.

But, considering the possiblity that it is a common bat, the EOO could be > 20,000 km. Being a lowland species, possiblities of habitat destruction is very high, though not known due to human settlements. No sightings in the last 3 years in two separate regions (Myanmar & Sri lanka) indicates a possible reduction of numbers in population size. Immediate survey is essential in other regions. public awareness in the sense that people who find a bat can take it to the researcher to identify it. Sri Lankan population is a suspect, the quality and quantity of habitat have drastically declined. Southern Myanmar population is unknown [Swe], Northern Myanmar holds a sustainable population [Bates]. Since there is definitive information in Sri Lanka and Myanmar, we suspect a decrease in population.

Taxonomy of small, big footed Myotis is complex. Species is very difficult to identify unless there is enough expertise. Identification should be done with great care. Since the species is restricted in its distribution, the species might not be found in these localities already surveyed and has to be surveyed for confirmation. Considering that occurrence is full Himalayan range and considering its occupancy in other countries in addition of new records.  Since it ccurs in Pune, Meghalaya and Myanmar, the EOO is justified.  Specimens from Pune not published but confirmed.  The new record by Korad and Yardi in Pune might force Pune population to be considered fragmented.  In Afghanistan, bombing could have affected the species. Normally it was recorded at higher altitudes from 1500-2000m.  However there are records of collection from 300 and 600m.  There is seasonal migration during breeding season in Myanmar [Swe].  Mature Individuals in Kashmir caves - 5000, 2 caves in Afghanistan - 7000 (B&H), so population more than 10,000. Habitat management is essential in view of recent developments in Afghanistan.  Fragmented population in few locations, one or two caves have large population.If the entire area is taken into consideration for distribution (greater than 20,000) and when taken individually, the criteria would change from Near Threatened to Least concern (?). - (Paul Bates)","India, Myanmar, Nepal, and AfghanistanAFGHANISTAN: Jalalabad, Lalanda, Pialeh Cave: INDIA: Jammu & Kashmir: Bahmajo Bat Cave, Bhima Devi, Bumzov Cave, Matar Nag; Meghalaya: Mausami Cave, Cherrapunji, Siju Cave; Maharashtra: Guruwarpeth; MYANMAR (NORTHERN): Twin-tae; NEPAL: Syangja"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,"> 2,001 sq km."                                                                                                          ,"> 20,000 sq km.

According to Korad change in habitat approx. 80% primarily due to human interference. Population trends based on 7 individuals per colony at 11 locations. This estimate maybe highly conservative and not representative of a true population. Mistry and Sreepada strongly disagree with the status because it is based upon unreliable population estimate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,"India, Myanmar, China, Vietnam, Indonesia to Borneo INDIA: Meghalaya: Konshnong; Sikkim: Bakkim; Uttaranchal: Dwali, Dogalbita, Mussoorie; West Bengal: Siliguri, Ghum; MYANMAR (NORTHERN): Hai Bum, Adung Valley; NEPAL: Kathmandu Valley"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,"> 2,000 sq km.

Only one specimen was collected from Meghalaya using mist net. The population might be larger.  Recorded at Barapede cave, Karnataka, South India; one record in northeastern India and one record in Cambodia.  Meghalaya specimen needs authentication. Genetic research is currently being conducted to determine whether the SW, NE Indian populations are related and how these are related to the specimen recently collected from Combodia. Probably Barpede and Meghalaya specimens belong to two different populations. At Barapede, construction activities can submerge foraging areas and other roosting sites. Main threat is loss of roost site and disturbance at the roost. No loss of roost site was observed (M.S. Pradhan). Single population in need of special attention. If any activity detrimental to the location occurs it may wipe out the entire population of the species. More collections from the area recently. Barpede population as per A. Thabah's study last summer (2001). Population can decline due to habitat destruction in future.  If any activity detrimental to one location occurs it may wipeout the entire population of the species. Collection for the purpose of biochemical, genetical, cytological, histological, physiological studies etc. research has to be discouraged for next 5-10 years since the population is very small and stable and is occurring in limited habitat."                               ,"India, CambodiaINDIA: Karnataka: Barapede cave; Meghalaya: Siju cave"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,< 10 sq km.                                                                                                               ,"< 5,000 sq km."                                                                ,2 / 2                       ,Narrow cracks and deep hollows in roof. 800m.                                                                                                                                                                    ,"India, Cambodia"                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,         ,                        ,              ,          ,Stable.  <10% decline in the population likely in the future.                                                     ,                           ,< 250                                                                                                                                             ,                   ,Fragmented                                     ,                             ,4-6 years                                            ,Natural caves; Tropical rainforest; natural caves.                                                                        ,       ,                ,"Cave dweller, insectivorous, diurnal (?).

It is a priority species for survey to determine if viable populations exist. The species appears to be threatened in the wild. It is a suitable candidate for captive breeding. Such breeding programs have worked well with other flying fox species. Car Nicobar specimens are slightly different in colour. So the mixing of this population with the other populations is not known. Needs more studies for more information. Endemic to India. Known from three small (localities) islands. All information is inferred from three dead specimens. Found in three islands.

However recent report from Pune needs to be reassessed. Current studies on mainland India suggest that this species may have a wide distribution than the previous record if identification is validated. Corbet and Hill (1992) suggest that Pteropus giganteus may prove to be con-specific with Pteropus vampyrus if so, P. vampyrus is a prior name according to Bates and Harrison (1997). Recent mainland record not yet published. Other records from Andaman & Nicobar Islands are possibly migrants rather than indegenous population (Mason, 1908; Hill, 1967). Mason (1908) suggested that this species is a seasonal migrant in the area."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,"Borneo, Java, India, Indochina, Malay Peninsula, Philippines, southern Myanmar, Sumatra  INDIA: Andaman & Nicobar Islands: no exact locality, Car Nicobar, Nicobar Islands (seasonal migrant); Maharashtra: Pune (?)"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,11-500 sq km.                                                                                                             ,"101-5,000 sq km.

Two subspecies are recognized i) R.c. cognatus (South Andaman) and ii) R.c. famulus (North Central Andaman & Narcondam Island) - [Bates & Harrison, 1997]. Not recorded from Nicobar Islands.  Extensive monitoring and habitat assessment is required. Given the limited distribution, known captures and lack of any knowledge of this species; this should be a priority taxon for population monitoring. There is no recent data on population status of this species, so nothing is known on decline or fluctuations. Based on the fact that since 1906 this species has been reported from Adaman & Nicobar Islands, it is presumed that no fluctuation in their locations might have occurred. There is no recent data on this species, so nothing is known on habitat status. However tourism development may affect the species. The small population size and limited genetic diversity may lead to problems of inbreeding.  Cave dwelling species typically face more stochastis trends, but nothing is known for sure in this species.  EOO 600 sq km based on the minimum convex polygon between known localities PHVA is essential considering the small and endemic nature of the species."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,"Endemic to South Asia (India)INDIA: Andaman & Nicobar Islands: Port Blair, North Central Andaman Island, Narcondam Island "                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,11-500 sq km.                                                                                                             ,"101-5,000 sq km.

Description based on Sinha, 1973.Sinha examined the specimen at ZSI. It has a strange distribution, which cannot be explained zoogeographically. This suggests that 1. It has a larger distribution 2. That the original specimen was mislabelled or probably came from somewhere else (since many specimens came from England, Ghana, India etc.) 3. Possibly misidentified [Bates]. Y.P.

Recorded for the first time in western India.  Pune records need to be taxonomically verified. Population numbers based on the number of locations and roosting sites. Around 10 individuals present in a colony. Because of urbanization, breaking down of old buildings and sometimes large trees there is every likelihood of decline in population in western India (Pune). The status was derived considering the number of mature individuals, fragmented population and probable threats.

Small number of very large colonies are known from Myanmar. The situation elsewhere in the region is not currently known. Destruction of one large roost (300,000) in Myanmar through the extraction of limestone by cement industries could have a significant impact on the abundance of this species in this region.
