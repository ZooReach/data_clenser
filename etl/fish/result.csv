Subsequent and recent surveys in the rivers have not recorded this species thereby suggesting a drastic decline of close to 100% due to habitat loss and other threats that are not yet clearly understood. The species' identity may need further scrutiny in some locations it has been reported from, and in addition the confirmed locations need to be surveyed thoroughly before its status can be assessed as Extinct. It is therefore presently assessed as Critically Endangered (possibly extinct)."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,"Least Concern N/A"                                            ,""        ,"2010"         ,""              ,"Molur, S."                                  ,"Rema Devi, K.R., Gopalakrishnan, A., Arunachalam, M., Shrikant, J., Johnson, J.A., Rahul, K. & Molur, S."                              ,"Raghavan, R. & Ali, A."                                ,"Brachirus orientalis is assessed as Least Concern in view of its wide marine distribution as well as its occurrence in coastal brackish and freshwater streams and lakes, there are no major threats and because the population is unlikely to be declining.

Shaji pers. comm.). It was last sighted in 1998 in Kabini River in Wyanad by C.P. Shaji. B.M. Kurup has been surveying the river since 2000 but has not recorded this species even once. It was last recorded in Tungabhadra in the 1980s (Singit et al. 1987) but the recent report of fishes of Bhadra River does not include this species in the checklist (Shahnawaz et al. 2010). It is likely that the species has disappeared from Kabini and Bhadra. The third location, which is Moyar River in Mudumalai was last surveyed in 1990-1992 when the species was collected (Manimekalan 1998). Subsequent surveys in Mudumalai by M. Arunachalam (pers. comm.) did not yield any specimens from 1996 to 2000. The identity of the species from Bhadra and Mudumalai is questionable (M. Arunachalam pers. comm.). The population has declined close to 100% in the known locations since the late 1990s.

Milt cryopreservation is done as part of ex-situ gene banking of this species (NBFGR 2000)."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,""                           ,"1, 1.2"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,""                   ,""               ,""                  ,"Ali, A.P.H., Raghavan, R and Prasad, G. 2007.

It is reported from the Nilgiris Bisophere, Travancroe, Achankovil, Periyar and Kabani rivers (Kurup et al. 2004).

Presence of Mystus montanus in northeastern India especially in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh (Tamang et al. 2007, Bagra et al. 2009) could be attributed to the synonymization of M. montanus dibrugarensis with this species.

Although the extent is slightly wide (<25000 km2), the area of occupancy is restricted to less than 200 km2."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,""   ,""   ,""        ,""         ,"Native: India (Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra - Presence Uncertain)"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,""         ,""                              ,""              ,"There is no information on the population status of B. mysorensis.

The generic status is often debated. Day (1878) considered the genus Nemachilichthys, which is followed by Jayaram (1999), while Banarescu and Nalbant (1968) considered the genus Noemacheilus, which is followed by Menon (1987, 1999). Talwar and Jhingran (1991) considered the genus Nemacheilus, which is currently valid. Nemachilichthys shimogensis (Rao 1920) was synonymized with Nemacheilus rueppelli by several workers (Talwar and Jhingran 1991, Jayaram 1999, Menon 1999). However, Banarescu and Nalbant (1968) have suggested that the two species are separate and while N. rueppelli is restricted to the tributaries of Krishna River in northern Western Ghats, N. shimogensis is restricted to Tungabhadra and its head waters. Currently, Froese and Pauly (2010) and Eschmeyer and Fricke (2010) consider the two species distinct."                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,"Least Concern     ver 3.1"                                    ,""        ,"2010"         ,""              ,"Molur, S."                                  ,"Rema Devi, K.R., Gopalakrishnan, A., Arunachalam, M., Shrikant, J., Johnson, J.A., Rahul, K. & Molur, S."                              ,"Dahanukar, N."                                         ,"Nemacheilus rueppelli is assessed as Least Concern based on the fact that its expected extent of occurrence and number of locations are more than the threshold for any threatened category and no wide spread threats have yet been identified for the species.

It is mainly recorded from the Western Ghats of Maharashtra but it could be found in the northern Karnataka. Population in the southern Karnataka, mainly from the Tungabhadra river, is Nemachilichthys shimogensis. Therefore, the records of Nemacheilus rueppelli by Bhat (2004) and Shahnawaz and Venkateshwarlu (2009) should be verified as they could be Nemachilichthys shimogensis.In Maharashtra the species is known from Indrayani River (Mandar Paingankar, Rupesh Raut, S. S. Kharat and Neelesh Dahanukar, manuscript in preparation), Mula-Mutha River (Sykes 1841, Fraser 1942, Tonapi and Mulherkar 1963, Kharat et al. 2003, Wagh and Ghate 2003), Bhima river (Sykes 1841), Neera river (Neelesh Dahanukar, Mandar Paingankar, Rupesh Raut and S.S.

Although the location where this species is found is inside a protected area the species is currently threatened by two exotic species (Tilapia and Common Carp), which exhibit major dietary overlap and therefore interspecific competition.  The impact of the exotics to the habitat needs further study.  In addition, the introduction of the African Catfish is a potential threat to the species.  Urgent detailed studies are recommended to understand the impacts of exotics as the species may be in a higher degree of threat and may need to be assessed soon again.

The number of locations estimated for this species is 6-10 and the population is severely fragmented. Although this fish is found in at least one protected site at Kudremukh National Park, the areas where it generally occurs are threatened by deforestation, urbanization and urban and industrial pollution. Furthermore, this species is very rare. If further research finds that its AOO is actually less than the inferred AOO used for this assessment, then a reassessment may result in this species being moved into a threatened category."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,""                                                            ,""                  ,""                               ,""               ,""        ,"Garra bicornuta is endemic to the Western Ghats of India (Ponniah and Gopalakrishnan 2000, Dahanukar et al. 2004).

Jayaram (1995) has suggested that the species is also found in the Krishna River stretch between Wai and Bagalkot. This species is also recorded from Wadgaon on Bhima River by Suter (1944) and Nira River at Veer dam (Ghate and Pawar 1992) and Bhor (Dahanukar et al, submitted).

In addition, information should be generated on the population and life history of this species."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,""                           ,"1, 1.1, 1.2, 3, 3.4, 3.4.1, 3.4.2"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,""                   ,""               ,""                  ,"Arunachalam, M. 2000.

Reports of the species from other areas need to be verified. Its area of occupancy is very small, possibly less than 10 km_, however based on the major threats of habitat loss and degradation due to water abstraction, encroachment, plantation run-off and the drying up of streams, the species is currently found in four locations (it has already been extirpated from one location). It is therefore listed as Endangered."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,""                                                            ,""                  ,""                               ,""               ,""        ,"Horalabiosa joshuai is endemic to the Kalakkad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve of the Western Ghats (Silas 1953, Devi 1992, Johnson and Arunachalam 2010).

This species is one of the most preferred food fish and are harvested from the rivers and reservoirs where it occurs. The species is under threat from an on-going decline in habitat quality as a result of pollution, destructive fishing and exotic species in its natural range. The species has been introduced to several different reservoirs and river systems where the populations are not viable due to similar threats. However, this assessment is only of the natural wild population."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,""                                                            ,""                  ,""                               ,""               ,""        ,"Hypselobarbus dubius is endemic to the Cauvery River basin in southern Western Ghats (Dahanukar et al. 2004, Devi et al. 2005).

The species has not been recorded since then although several comprehensive surveys in different drainages have been made. There has been a reported collection of this species (30 from the type locality in Dakshina Kannada) in recent times, however these specimens need confirmation as when compared with the type housed at ZSI, Kolkata they were found to be different (M.

The distribution of this species is entirely based on reports made in the early half of the last century (1929-1941): drainages in Trivandrum District (Pillai 1929, John, 1936); Periyar National Park and Tiger Reserve as well as River Chaliyar at Nilambur (Raj 1941). It was not recorded throughout 1950-2010 from Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu parts of Western Ghats, although this area has been comprehensively explored (Easa and Basha 1995, Chhapgar and Mankadan 2000, Chandrashekhariah et al. 2000, Gopi 2000, Thomas 2004, Biju 2005, Kurup et al. 2004).

Maharashtra, India. There has been considerable debate on the generic status of the species. This species has been treated as Tor mussullah by Talwar and Jhingran (1991), Jayaram (1997, 2005, 2010) following the discussions given in Hora (1943). Menon (1992, 1999), however suggested that the species considered as Tor mussullah by Hora (1943) is same as Tor khudree and he placed T. mussullah under genus Hypselobarbus following Rainboth (1989). However, both the original suggestion of the genus Hypselobarbus by Bleeker (1860), with Barbus mussullah as its type species, and resurrection of the resurrection of genus Hypselobarbus by Rainboth (1989) is based on the illustration by Sykes (1839) and not by examining specimens. Suggestions made by Hora (1943) that the species should be called Tor mussullah seems more valid as the species called as 'musunda' in the type locality of Barbus mussullah and neighboring areas is indeed a Tor species (Neelesh Dahanukar pers. obs.).

So the trends cannot be generalized."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,"Stable"                  ,""                           ,""                  ,""                   ,""                       ,""                             ,""               ,"Labeo boggut is found in rivers and reservoirs (Menon 1999, Yazdani and Singh 1990).

In Kerala, it is known from four rivers, Pampa, Achenkovil, Manimala and Meenachil (Kurup 2000), the southern tip of Vembanad Lake (Narayanan et al. 2005; Kurup 2000), and Periyar (Gopalakrishnan et al. 2009). In Sri Lanka they have been recorded from various rivers (Smith 1991) and reservoirs (Amarasinghe and Pitcher 1986, De Silva 1998). Labeo rajasthanicus from Jaisamand Lake in Udaipur has been found to be the same as L. dussumieri and therefore needs to be synonymised (Gopalakrishnan pers. comm.).  The record from Alibagh, Maharastra by Jayram (2010) needs verification.  The Sri Lankan population needs taxonomic verification as it may be a different species. The populations from different rivers in Kerala were found to be genetically homogeneous (Gopalakrishnan pers. comm.) but the morpho-meristics analysis of populations from different river systems, showed that the populations are different (Kurup and Kuriakose 1996)."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,""   ,""   ,""        ,""         ,"Native: India (Kerala)- Present - origin uncertain: Sri Lanka"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,""         ,""                              ,""              ,"L. dussumieri has shown considerable decline in their population in southern Kerala (Kurup 2000), largely due to exploitation (Kurup 1998).

There is no recent estimate of the population of L. dussumieri but local knowledge of fishers in Kerala indicate that the species has shown a decline in the recent past. The species has now revived in Pampa with a total annual landing of 30 tonnes in 2009 compared to 3 tonnes in 1988-89 (B.M. Kurup pers. obs.).

Presence of this fish in Sri Lanka is due to synonymy of Labeo porcellus lankae with Labeo porcellus. Since this synonymy is doubtful (Menon 1999) the presence of this species in Sri Lanka is also doubtful. In India the species is known from Western Ghats of Maharashtra (Hora and Misra 1937, Kalawar and Kelkar 1956, Jayaram and Dhas 2000, Ponniah and Gopalakrishnan 2000, Kharat et al. 2003, Wagh and Ghate 2003) and Karnataka (David 1956, Jayaram and Dhas 2000, Shahnawaz et al. 2010, Jadhav et al. 2011). It is mainly confined to east flowing rivers but Bhat (2004) recorded it from a west flowing river in Karnataka, however, exact locality is not mentioned. Occurrence of this species in Badoda (now Vadodara) in Gujrat (Ranade 1953) and central India (Sarkar and Lakra 2007) is doubtful."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,""   ,""   ,""        ,""         ,"Native: India (Karnataka, Maharashtra)"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,""         ,""                              ,""              ,"Exact population status of Labeo porcellus is not known, but the species is relatively rare (Shahnawaz and Venkateshwarlu 2009, Jadhav et al. 2011).

The generic status of this species has often been debated. In later years Day (1877) himself consider this species as Scaphiodon nashii while Hora (1942), and subsequently Talwar and Jhingran (1991), treated this species as Osteochilus (Osteochilichthys) nashii. Jayaram (1999) considered this species as Osteochilichthys nashii and the species appears as Cyprinion nashii in Menon (1999). Currently the species is valid as Osteochilus nashii. Menon (1999) considered another species Osteochilus godavarensis as a synonym of Osteochilus nashii without giving any reason and currently this synonymy is considered as valid. However, the two species are remarkably different as the former has two pairs of barbels while the later is completely devoid of barbels (Talwar and Jhingran 1991, Jayaram 1999) and there are several other major differences as well (N.

It is known from the rivers Tungabhadra (Bhimachar and Rao1941, David 1956, Shahnawaz and Venkateshwarlu 2009, Shahnawaz et al. 2010), Sharavathi (Sreekantha et al. 2007), Bedti (Bhat 2004), Bhavani and Moyar  (Mukerji 1931, Rajan 1955, 1963), Chandragiri, Chaliyar, Kabini, Valapatnam (Chhapgar and Mankadan 2000, Easa and Basha 1995, Kurup et al. 2004, Shaji and Easa 1995), Uruttipuzha and Cheenkannipuzha (Shaji et al. 1995),  Pavana (Patil et al. 2007), Mula-Mutha (Kharat et al. 2003, Suter 1944, Wagh and Ghate 2003) and Koyana river (Jadhav et al. 2011). Thomas et al. (2002) collected O. nashii from River Periyar, the first (and only) record from south of the Palakkad gap. However, subsequent surveys in the same river and its tributaries, and also other rivers south of Palakkad gap by various researchers (Kurup et al. 2004, Kurup et al. 2006) did not result in the collection of this species. It is therefore reasonable to suspect that Thomas et al. (2002) record of O. nashii from Periyar was a misidentification. David (1963) suggested that O. nashii is present in Krishna river but not in Godavari river. Menon (1999) synonymized Osteocheilus godavarensis (Rao 1977) with O. nashii extending the range of O. nashii to Godavari river. However, these two species are remarkably different (Talwar and Jhingran 1991, Jayaram 1999, Neelesh Dahanukar pers. obs.).

Hora (1921) changed the generic status of the fish to Parapsilorhynchus. This species is also recorded from Godavari river in Satpura hill ranges and Eastern Ghats. This wide distribution and isolated records suggests that there is a need to evaluate the taxonomic identity of this species. It is possible that the species known as Parapsilorhynchus tentaculatus is in fact a species complex. Further taxonomic studies aided with molecular phylogeny are essential to resolve this problem."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,"Least Concern     ver 3.1"                                    ,""        ,"2010"         ,""              ,"Molur, S."                                  ,"Rema Devi, K.R., Gopalakrishnan, A., Arunachalam, M., Shrikant, J., Johnson, J.A., Rahul, K. & Molur, S."                              ,"Dahanukar, N."                                         ,"Parapsilorhynchus tentaculatus is assessed as Least Concern because of its wide spread distribution in Krishna and Godavari river basins.

Subsequently Menon and Devi (1992) observed that P. puckelli was distinct from P. dorsalis and placed it under P. bimaculatus of Sri Lanka.

The EOO is inferred to be between 3000-5000 based on the area of the hydrobasins where it is projected to occur. As there are 4 major dams on this river (Bhat 2004) the projected population might be fragmented. Further, since this river is known to be heavily polluted by industrial effluents (Bhat 2004) it is likely that the habitat quality is declining. Therefore, based on the presence information this species is assessed as Endangered.

The habitat from where Puntius fraseri is recorded is threatened by organic pollution, agricultural pollution, introduced fishes and heavy harvesting. Further, it seems that the populations of this species are decreasing. The last known collection of this species was in 1956 although a collection from 1978 has been recently tentatively identified as P. fraseri.  Several surveys in and around the type locality has not revealed the presence of this species.  It is likely that the species may be more threatened than what is assessed presently.  The taxonomic identity of the collections from Sholapur and Krishna drainage have to be thoroughly examined to establish the species' distribution range."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,""                                                            ,""                  ,""                               ,""               ,""        ,"Puntius fraseri is endemic to the Western Ghats of India (Dahanukar et al. 2004). It is found in Darna river, an upper tributary of the Godavari river system, in Deolali, Nashik (Hora and Misra 1939). Kalawar and Kelkar (1956) reported the species from Panchaganga river, an upper tributary of the Krishna river system, in Kolhapur. Even though, Kalawar and Kelkar (1956) have given detailed taxonomic comment in support of their report, presence of this species in Krishna river system is highly unlikely. An extensive survey of the Krishna river system by Jayaram (1995) could not report this species. Furthermore, the species has not been recorded by any other study in Krishna river system. A more detailed investigation is required to conform the presence of the species in the Krishna river system. Both Jayaram (1991) and Talwar and Jhingran (1991) have restricted the species only to the Darna river. Recently, a collection from Sholapur district done in 1978 by A.S. Mahabal, was identified as P. fraseri (S. Jadhav pers. comm.), however, this report needs confirmation. Report of the species from Pune by Menon (1999) is a result of synonymization of Puntius deccanensis with P. fraseri. However, this synonymy is not considered valid. Therefore, Puntius fraseri is restricted only to the Darna river in Nashik and the expected extent of occurrence of 2500-3000 km2 and 5 number of locations."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,""   ,""   ,""        ,""         ,"Native: India (Maharashtra)"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,""         ,""                              ,""              ,"Exact population trends are not available for Puntius fraseri, however, the population seems to be declining and it is rarely found in its type locality (S.

Hora (1942)  revised the generic status of the fish and considered it as Osteochilus (Osteochilichthys) thomassi. Pethiyagoda and Kottelat (1994) and Jayaram (2010) consider this species as Osteochilichthys thomassi, while Menon (1999) has synonimized the species to Cyprinion nashii (Menon 1999). However, the species is valid in Eschmeyer and Fricke (2011).

In India it is known from Kaveri river system in  Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and Tambraparni river system in Tamil Nadu (Hora 1937, Cherian et al. 2000, Devi et al. 2005, Johnson and Arunachalam 2009). It is alos known from freshwater lakes in Chennai and Mysore (Daniels and Rajagopal 2004, Prasad et al. 2009). It is also known from Kovalam, Moyar and Kattappana rivers (R. Kumar pers. comm.). Records of this species from Krishna river system at Sholapur and Pune districts in Maharashtra by Jadhav and Yadav (2009) are likely to be based on wrong identification. This is because, in their rather vague species account authors mention that there are 32 scales along the lateral line, while Rasbora caverii, based on the more detailed re-description given by Hora (1937), has 36 to 37 scales."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,""   ,""   ,""        ,""         ,"Native: India (Karnataka, Maharashtra - Presence Uncertain, Tamil Nadu); Sri Lanka"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,""         ,""                              ,""              ,"Data on population status of this species is not available, however the species is common throughout its range."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,"Stable"                  ,""                           ,""                  ,""                   ,""                       ,""                             ,""               ,"It is a pelagic species found in a wide variety of habitats often in large shoals.

There was a debate over the generic status of this species. Heckel (1843) designated a new genus Osteobrama and and changed the status of Rohtee ogilbii to Osteobrama ogilbii. The status of the fish was changed to Systomus ogilbii by Bleeker (1853). Hora (1937) changed the generic status of the fish to Mystacoleucus, however, Smith (1945) objected to this change.

However, it is essential to note that the populations of this species, especially in the upper Godavary, Bhima and Tungabhadra river, are threatened by urban and industrial pollution, increasing urbanization, severe deforesting leading to siltation and invasive fish like Tilapia. Mula-Mutha river population has faced rapid declines in the last ten years.

Menon (1992) considered this species as a dwarf cognate of Tor khudree, however, Jayaram (1999, 2005, 2010) considered T. kulkarnii as a synonym of T. khudree. Even though T. kulkarnii is considered as valid species (Menon 1999, 2004, Nautiyal et al. 2008) this species is remarkably similar to T. khudree and the observed differences could only be population variations rather than species variations. Therefore, taxonomic status of T. kulkarnii is questionable. The types examined indicate Tor kulkarnii to be a distinct species (M. Arunachalam pers. comm.), however, since Tor exhibits a high degree of phenotypic plasticity, a good comparative and molecular study of types of both the species is urgently required.

Menon (1992) synonymised this species with Tor khudree while Indra (1993) considered it as a valid sub species.

Note that the publication mentions latitude longitude for the type locality as  11°21' N and 76°53' E, but the correct latitude longitude is 10°59' 20.39'' N and 76°26' 33.51'' E (K.V. Radhakrishnan pers. comm.). The Bharathapuza River drains the western face of the Western Ghats and debouches into the Lakshadweep Sea. Based on the current information the species is found in the hydrobasin with area 1000 km2, However it is expected to be found in adjoining basins as well. So the EOO for the species is around 5000 km2 with only one location.

Dahanukar pers. obs.) is likely a recent introduction of this species since 2008 as it was not found from these areas before 2008 (Yazdani and Singh 1990, Kharat et al. 2003)."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,""   ,""   ,""        ,""         ,"Native: Bangladesh; Cambodia; China; India (Andaman Is., Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Laccadive Is., Maharashtra, Orissa, Pondicherry, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal); Malaysia; Myanmar; Pakistan; Sri Lanka; Taiwan, Province of China; Thailand; Viet Nam"                                                                   ,""         ,"Native: Indian Ocean – western",""              ,"This is a very common species in India.

Generic status of this fish has often been debated. Jerdon (1849) considered this species as Bagrus goongvaree (a wrong spelling for goongwaree), while Günther (1864) and Day (1877) considered this species to be valid as Pseudeutropius goonguaree. Generic status of the fish was revised by Hora (1937) to Eutropiichthys and subsequent workers (Talwar and Jhingran 1991, Jayaram 1999, Menon 1999) have adapted the same. Recently, Ferraris and Vari (2007) objected to the generic status given by Hora (1837) based on the figure of this fish given by Sykes (1841). However, they have not considered the text given by Sykes (1841) where he has clearly stated that the species is remarkably similar to Pimelodus vacha which is considered as Eutropiichthys vacha by Ferraris and Vari (2007). Ferraris (2007) suspected that Eutropiichthys goongwaree is more likely a species of Proeutropiichthys. Chakrabarty and Ng (2005) have suggested that BMNH 1857.6.13.158 could be the type specimen of Eutropiichthys goongwaree and further study might reveal proper taxonomic status of this species. Currently the species is considered valid as Eutropiichthys goongwaree.","Data Deficient     ver 3.1"                                   ,""        ,"2010"         ,""              ,""                                           ,"Shrikant, J. & Cox, N.A."                                                                                                              ,"Dahanukar, N."                                         ,"Eutropiichthys goongwaree is assessed as Data Deficient because currently it is known from only four isolated localities and it is difficult to estimate the area of occupancy and extent of occurrence for the fish as the inferred range of the species cannot be predicted. Furthermore, there is no information on the population status of the fish. The species has not been recorded from its type locality in spite of seven independent surveys during 1942 to 2003. However, it is essential to note that the type locality of the fish is threatened by organic and inorganic pollution, urbanization, introduced fish and heavy harvesting of fishes."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,""                                                            ,""                  ,""                               ,""               ,""        ,"Eutropiichthys goongwaree is known from Mula-Muth rivers of Pune (the upper tributaries of Krishna river system) (Sykes 1839, 1841). This species was also recorded from Urmodi tributary of Koyna River in Satara (S. Jadhav pers. comm. 2010). Recently this species was reported from Mylavaram Dam on Pennar River in Andhra Pradesh by Vankateshwarlu, Rema Devi and Indra (Manon 1999) and Nagarjunasagar on Krishna River in Andhra Pradesh (Venkateshwarlu et al. 2006). Report of the fish from Burma (now Myanmar) (Day 1869) and Bengal (Beavan 1877) are not valid (Menon 1999). The species is therefore restricted to Krishna River system and Pennar River system in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh (Menon 1999). Since the species is not recorded from its type locality after its original description, in spite of serious efforts (Fraser 1942, Tonapi and Mulherkar 1963, Kharat et al. 2003, Wagh and Ghate 2003), and currently the species is known only from three isolated localities, the AOO and EOO cannot be estimated and inferred range of the species cannot be predicted."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,""   ,""   ,""        ,""         ,"Native: India (Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal); Myanmar"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,""         ,""                              ,""              ,"No information is available on the population status of Eutropiichthys goongwaree.

This expected extent of occurrence is more than the threshold for any threatened category. However, the expected number of localities (drainages) is between 7 to 10, the number of locations are many, but the habitat of this fish may be severely threatened by damming, indiscriminate de-forestation and subsequent conversion of forest area into agricultural plantations.

If it is proved that the populations in northern India, Nepal and China belong to the same species it is still Least Concern, while if it is proved that the species is restricted only to the Nilgiri hills in Cauvery watershed, it may qualify under a threatened category.

Therefore the species is assessed as Data Deficient."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,""                                                            ,""                  ,""                               ,""               ,""        ,"Glyptothorax malabarensis is endemic to Western Ghats of India and currently it is known only from hill stream of Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary (Urutty Stream, Valapattanam River drainage), Kannur District, Kerala, India (Gopi 2010)."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,""   ,""   ,""        ,""         ,"Native: India (Kerala)"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,""         ,""                              ,""              ,"No information is available on the population status of Glyptothorax malabarensis.

The species is believed to be locally extinct from its type locality in the Mula-Mutha river (Kharat et al. 2003). Further, the species is threatened by habitat modifications caused by dams, rapid developments in urbanization and increasing pollution in this area. The species is therefore assessed as Endangered."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,""                                                            ,""                  ,""                               ,""               ,""        ,"Glyptothorax poonaensis is endemic to the Western Ghats of India (Dahanukar et al. 2004).

It is known from Maharashtra and Karnataka. In Maharashtra it is known from Koyna valley and Yenna (Venna) valley (Hora 1938) and Koyna river near Patan (Jadhav et al. 2011). In Karnataka it is known from Shimoga (Hora 1938) and Kigga falls on Tunga river (Arunachalam 2000). This species is also expected to be present in the hill streams of areas between the known localities. The expected extent of occurrence (EOO) of this species will be around 40000 km2, however, as the species is restricted to hill streams with rapid water flow and is habitat specific, the area of occupancy of the fish may be hardly 2000 km2 (5% of EOO). Currently the species is known only from 5 localities."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,""   ,""   ,""        ,""         ,"Native: India (Karnataka, Maharashtra)"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,""         ,""                              ,""              ,"Precise population status of Glyptothorax trewavasae is not known, although there is some indication of its decline.

Records of this species from India are because of the synonymy of Syngnathus argyrostictus to Hippichthys penicillus. In India the species is recorded from Cochin (now Kochi) in  Kerala (Day 1865) and Mysore in Karnataka (Hora 1925). There are no recent records of this fish from India. Talwar and Jhingran (1991) have doubted the presence of this species from India.Even though the presence of this species in India needs confirmation, the species is widely distributed."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,""   ,""   ,""        ,""         ,"Native: Australia; Cambodia; China; Indonesia; Japan; Malaysia; Myanmar; Thailand; Viet Nam, Presence uncertain: India (Karnataka, Kerala)"                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,""         ,""                              ,""              ,"No information is available on the population trends in Hippichthys penicillus."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,"Unknown"                 ,""                           ,""                  ,""                   ,""                       ,""                             ,""               ,"Hippichthys penicillus is found in lower reaches of streams and rivers, seagrass beds in estuaries and other shallow inshore habitats and it attains a standard length of 18 cm (Froese and Pauly 2010).

Even though the extent of occurrence (EOO) of this species is 15,000-16,000km² (calculated as the area of known and inferred hydrobasins), it is likely to be restricted to an area of occupancy (AOO) of 300-500 km² as it prefers marshy areas and swamps."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,""   ,""   ,""        ,""         ,"Native:

This species is known to have taxonomic ambiguities. Shaji and Easa (2003) opined that G. davissinghi could not be separated from its closest relative, G. madraspatanum, and therefore can be considered only as a junior synonym. Similarly, K.V. Radhakrishnan (pers. comm.) mentions that G. annandalei collected from Karimpuzha had highly overlapping morpho-meristic characters with G. davissinghi and therefore the taxonomic validity of the latter is questionable.

It is reliably recorded only from the Krishna River system and its records from Narmada (Dubey 1984) needs taxonomic validation. Menon (1999, 2004) suggests that the record of this species from the Kaveri River system by Hora and Law (1941) needs conformation. The record of Gagata itchkeea from Godavari River at Deolali (David 1963, Menon 1999) comes from a correction of the record of Nangra viridescens by Hora and Misra (1937). However, the species account for the Nangra viridescens (also from Godavari River at Deolali) by Fraser (1937) does not exactly match the description of Gagata itchkeea collected from Pune (Neelesh Dahanukar pers. obs.).

In the Krishna River system, this species is known from Mula-Mutha river of Pune (Fraser 1942, Kharat et al. 2003, Wagh and Ghate 2003), Panchaganga River at Kolhapur (Kalawar and Kelkar 1956), Pavna River (Chandanshive et al. 2007), Krishna River at Solapur (Jadhav and Yadav 2009), Krishna River between Wai to Bagalkot and between Jamkhandi to Lingalagattu (Jayaram 1995), and the Tungabhadra River (Shahnawaz and Venkateshwarlu 2009, Shahnawaz et al. 2010).

The species is also recorded from Eastern Ghats (Devi and Indra 2003) but the exact locality is missing.

Even though the expected extent of occurrence (EOO) for the species is large, it is a habitat specialist and prefers clear, non-polluted, hill streams and high reaches of the river. So the conservative estimate for the area of occupancy (AOO) is likely to be between 1,000 and 1,200 km², with 7-10 fragmented locations."                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,""   ,""   ,""        ,""         ,"Native:

Since the populations are restricted to two locations, indiscriminate collections can possibly wipe out the species. However, with the increase in availability of captive bred fish from Indonesia, pressure on wild collection seems to have declined. Additional threats include both intentional and unintentional harvest as a food fish, pollution from agricultural and domestic sewage, and habitat alteration due to sand mining. In 1996 many fish in the Kumaradhara River died from pesticide poisoning (Gadgil et al. 2001).

Local fishers in the region have indicated that catches of T. khudree have declined drastically in the last few years, and only smaller juveniles appear in the nets, compared to large adults that were frequently caught in 1980’s (Minimol 2000, Raghavan et al. in press.). Use of dynamite for catching T. khudree is prevalent in most of the rivers and reservoirs of Kerala. Dynamite fishing has been documented from the Southern WG since the early 1940’s and continues to be one of the most widely used destructive fishing techniques practiced in the region (Kurup et al. 2004, Raghavan et al. 2008).  Although dynamite fishing has been banned vide the Travancore Cochin Fisheries Act of 1950 (Government of Kerala, India) there is very little enforcement, and the practice continues to exist even inside protected areas of the region (Abraham et al. 2010). Alien Invasive species especially Cyprinus carpio and Oreochromis mossambicus are known to be a major threat to T. khudree in Periyar Lake, one of the major habitats for this species in Southern Western Ghats (Arun 1999, Kurup et al. 2006). T. khudree is also threatened by loss of habitat and pollution from multiple sources in the upper reaches of many rivers of Western Ghats. Pollution of rivers, heavy harvest and competition created by the introduced carps hae been suggested as major causes for the disappearence of this speceis from its type locality in Mula-Mutha rivers of Pune (Kharat et al. 2003, Wagh and Ghate 2003).","5, 5.4, 5.4.1, 5.4.2, 6. 6.1,  7, 7.2, 7.2.9,  7.2.10, 8, 8.1, 8.1.2, 9, 9.1, 9.1.1, 9.3, 9.3.3, 11, 11.1, 11.3",""     ,""        ,"Conservation actions for protecting T. khudree have been taken up by both private and government organizations in the Western Ghats.

This species occurs in tributaries of Krishna River system namely Bhima River and its tributaries (Sykes 1841, Fraser 1942, Sarwade and Khillare 2010, Neelesh Dahanukar pers. obs.), Krishna River (Jayaram and Dhas 2000) and Tungabhadra River (David 1956, Shahnawaz and Venkateshwarlu 2009, Shahnawaz et al. 2010). The species has also been recorded from Kaveri Rver system (Shaji and Easa 1995, Rajeev Raghavan and Anvar Ali pers. obs.). David (1963) suggests that the species also occurs in Godavari, however, there are no reliable records. Menon (1999) suggests that the species occurs only in Krishna river system and excludes Kavery River system. Thus, it is essential to evaluate the taxonomic status of the fish from Kavery River system. Report of the species from Hyderabad (Chandrashekar 2004) needs more support and the paper also does not mention the exactly locality from where the species was collected.

The inferred extent of occurrence (EOO) of the species is large as it is distributed throughout the Western Ghats. However, the EOO is suspected to be declining as it is known that the populations of the species described from Mula-Mutha River by (Fraser 1942) are likely to be locally extinct (Kharat et al. 2000)."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,""   ,""   ,""        ,""         ,"Native:

(2000, 2003) and Wagh and Ghate (2003) were could not record it. In fact it is suspected that the species is locally extinct from Pune (Kharat et al. 2000). In Kerala, a population reduction of 99% has been observed over the past two decades (Kurup et al. 2003). There is no quantitative estimate of population decline of this species from Karnataka and Maharashtra, even though the species is likely to be facing a drastic decline in these areas too (based on the discussions with the fishermen from where the species is recently recorded, Neelesh Dahanukar pers. comm.). Based on the decline of the species in Kerala population, which might be just 20% of the total population of of this species, the conservative estimate of global decline of the species could be assumed to be between 50 to 60%.

The decline could be because of habitat alterations caused by anthropogenic activities including pollution, harvesting of the fish and competition created by introduced carps (Kharat et al. 2000, 2003, Wagh and Ghate 2003, Kurup et al. 2003, Menon 2004).","Decreasing"              ,""                           ,""                  ,""                   ,""                       ,""                             ,""               ,"Labeo potail is a benthopelagic species, which inhabits rivers and streams in the upper reaches (Menon 1999).

Recommendations for urgent surveys and population monitoring in the known areas as well as taxonomic validation of the other populations are made."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,""   ,""   ,""        ,""         ,"India (Karnataka, Kerala - Presence Uncertain)"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,""         ,""                              ,""              ,"There is no information on the population status of H. thomassi, nor are they any recent records from anywhere in Kerala or Karnataka.

The young, at 15–35 mm standard length (SL), are omnivorous including earthworms, aquatic insects, mostly larvae of chironomids and ephemeropterans and bits of filamentous algae and detritus in their diet.

The previous assessment for this species included a record from the Chalakudy River in the distribution, however this record is now known to be incorrect and is therefore excluded from this reassessment."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,""   ,""   ,""        ,""         ,"Native:

Sarwade and Khillare (2010) suggests that the species is less abundant in Ujani wetland, Maharashtra."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,"Stable"                  ,""                           ,""                  ,""                   ,""                       ,""                             ,""               ,"Barilius evezardi prefers clear hill streams in the upper reaches of river and it attains a total length of 11 cm (Menon 1999)."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,"Freshwater"        ,"5, 5.1"                                     ,""     ,""     ,""              ,"Exact distribution of Barilius evezardi is not known.
