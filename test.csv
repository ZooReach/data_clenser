Habitat fragmentation over the years has depleted the area available for this dry-zone taxon and restricted it to several small pockets. From 1956-1993 Sri Lanka lost more than 50% of forest cover to human activities, followed by a similar rate of decline in the remaining forest cover between 1994 and 2003.  Correlating loss of habitat to populations, rate of decline in population is inferred at more than 50% over 3 generations.  Also due to continuing trends past and predicted declines could reduce the population by more than 50% within the next 11 to 22 years due to continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat along with exploitation of the species observed in the wild.  The taxon is also threatened due to its restricted distribution of less than 1600km2 extent of occurrence and 400km2 area of occupancy and continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat, number of locations and in the number of mature individuals, the latter two inferred from threats to habitat and population from degradation and hunting, respectively.",                                         ,                  ,                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,"This species requires habitat conservation and natural breeding.   Geographical distribution is in lower slopes and hills of northern, eastern and southern aspects of central montane massif.  No sightings of grandis in lower plains of dry zone or wet zone. Sometimes, rustier pelage of adults and brown and reddish-brown young of grandis (Phillips, 1935) suggest that this form is more allied to lowland wet zone (L.t. tardigradus) than the lowland dry zone (L.t. nordicus) subspecies. Animal little known to its captors, many of them had not seen such a creature previously. Rewards failed to produce further specimens for months.  It would appear that the race is uncommon and sparsely distributed throughout its distribution area (Schulze, 2003).   The main distribution area of this subspecies is vulnerable to tourism, which may affect them.  The area is also highly exposed to agricultural practices and usage of agro-chemicals is increasing dramatically, which would adversely reduce the insect population, an important food source of this animal."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,                 ,   ,   ,        ,600-1200m.                                  ,                   ,         ,                        ,Endemic to Sri Lanka              ,          ,Declined by 50% or more in 3 generations and predicted to decline by >20% in the next 10 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,                           ,Not known                                   ,                   ,                       ,                             ,Estimated at 4-7 years                                       ,Tropical hill forest                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,       ,                ,"Nocturnal, arboreal, solitary, insectivorous, frugivorous, carnivorous (small lizards, eggs etc.)"                                                                                                         ,                                                                                                      ,              ,"Clear-cutting, deliberate fires, trade, habitat loss by use of chemicals in agriculture.

During a survey in 2001, in six locations visited, 98 sightings (excluding carried infants and calls) of L.t. nordicus were made; densities of L.t. nordicus from 0.33-38 animals per kilometer. Other than in areas afflicted with war (i.e. Jaffna, Wilpattu), L.t. nordicus seems to be the most success ful of the subspecies. It is found in areas surrounded by human disturbance, and was located in almost every area checked in the north. This subspecies adequately fits the description of Osman Hill (1933); present everywhere, but nowhere common (Schulze, 2003)."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,                 ,   ,   ,        ,Up to 350m in lowland dry zone of Sri Lanka.,                   ,         ,                        ,Endemic to Sri Lanka              ,          ,Declined by >50% in the last 3 generations and predicted to decline by >20% in the next 5 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,                           ,Not known                                   ,                   ,                       ,                             ,Not known (estimated to be 4-7 years)                        ,"Tropical dry evergreen forest, moist forest"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,       ,                ,"Arboreal, nocturnal, insectivore, frugivore, carnivore (small lizards, eggs etc.)"                                                                                                                         ,"Shrubs, trees."                                                                                      ,              ,"Hunting for folk medicine and habitat loss.

The size of possible habitat to which L.t. nycticeboides are endemic (montane rain and mist froest) is about 40,000 ha in several isolated areas. The subspecies has only been found in one of these areas, on Horton Plains. Osman Hill wrote of L.t. nycticeboides: “That the animal is rare in that locality is evidenced by the fact that Mr. Tunein-Noltenius has been on the look out for it for the previous twenty years without success”. Only two specimens have ever been found (in 1938), they and their offspring died in captivity. No recent sightings. In 1982, rangers said that slender lorises still occur on Horton Plains where temperatures may fall below 0°C during a survey in 2001, however, rangers and researchers who have worked in the park for years said they have never seen heard any evidence of lorises here (Schulz, 2003)."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,                 ,   ,   ,        ,1650-2000m.                                 ,                   ,         ,                        ,Endemic to Sri Lanka              ,          ,Declined by >80% in the last 200 years and is predicted to decline by >20% in the next 10 years.

The wet zone of Sri Lanka, habitat of L. t. tardigradus, covers 23% of the island (Total size: 66,000 km2). During a survey in 2001, in four locations visited, 24 actual sightings (excluding carried infants and calls) of L. t. tardigradus were made; densitites ranged from 0.86-11.7 animals per kilometer. Despite finding this species in two isolated forest patches, it has disappeared from much of its range as human settlements have expanded."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,                 ,   ,   ,        ,Up to 700m.                                 ,                   ,         ,                        ,Endemic to Sri Lanka              ,          ,"Declined by >50% in 3 generations and is predicted to decline by >10% in the next 5 years.

Techniques for captive breeding are known for this taxon or similar taxa. Sites in Bangladesh are the north-western-most geographical distribution of this subspecies.   Among the two sites where this species were found, one is already completely destroyed and only one known population is present at the moment.  However, there are some chances of this species to be found in nearby areas.  A systematic survey is essential in all its distribution areas in Bangladesh.

Developmental activities on Katchal Island is likely to cause urbanisation of the groups in the vicinity. The taxon is hunted mainly for subsistence living by Shompen tribals and also to protect coconut plantations.  The category is derived based on threats and trade. Based on the data available the working group is forced to conclude that this is of Least Concern. It must be stressed that this conclusion derives from data gathered on one very small survey and no extensive effort has been made recently to do more elaborate surveys. The working group is also concerned that if this is resolved the listing if the species under the Wildlife Protection Act may be diluted. Therefore the status of NT is suggested since any inaccuracy may result in the species being reclassified."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,                 ,   ,   ,        ,Up to 600m.                                 ,                   ,         ,                        ,Endemic to India (Nicobar Islands),          ,Stable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,                           ,<3000                                       ,                   ,                       ,                             ,10-12 years (inferred from M. sinica).                       ,"Mangroves, coastal forests predominantly dominated by Pandanus species"                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,       ,                ,"Semi-terrestrial, arboreal, diurnal, omnivorous"                                                                                                                                                           ,Tends to be arboreal in inland forests and terrestrial in coastal forests.                            ,              ,"Past threats: Human settlement, habitat loss

Most of the monkeys were trapped from the forests to export to USA, as urban monkeys were not preferred for research. Identification and distribution of subspecies needs further research to resolve taxonomic confusion. A survey to delineate boundaries of subspecies is required. Studies of population dynamics in forested and urban areas needed. This group has focused primarily on forest dwellers since those animals are of significance to conservation. On the other hand, the group recognises the fact that a significant decline in the number of forest dwellers is due to their migration to nearby human habitation where they seem to enjoy the more attractive yet extremely unstable habitat. In addition this phenomena is resulting in increasing man-animal conflict and is a serious problem which requires attention at the earliest.  The group also understands that the management strategies for the animals in forest and the commensal animals would have to be different. Initiate ex situ Program within 3 years in Nepal.  From some areas (Nepal, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, parts of Maharashtra, Dehra Dun) good data is available (reference cited). Other areas assessment is subjective based on known forested areas.   Changing human tolerance levels towards macaques is a threat.   Population in Bangladesh is under threat due to continuous conflict with humans.  Main rpoblem is due to increasing commensalism and population growth in urban and agricultural growth.   This is stimulated by a loss of forest habitat and tendency of humans to feed monkeys oin villages, temples and urban areas.",                 ,   ,   ,        ,"Up to 4,000m."                             ,                   ,         ,                        ,Non Endemic to South Asia         ,          ,Not known.

Three kinds of populations present: protected areas, reserve forests other than protected areas and in private forests and plantations.   The problem in areas outside protected areas is poor management to no management for LTM. There is need for having a national or regionally endorsed protection plan for LTM.   As it is a flagship species it may help in the protection of other rain forest species.  Ongoing ex situ program must be intensified or increased. Some techniques of propagation are known for taxon or similar taxon. A PHVA for LTM was conducted in 1993."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,                 ,   ,   ,        ,"100-1,800m."                               ,                   ,         ,                        ,Endemic to India                  ,          ,Declining in forest fragments and outside protected areas.

(2001) “Pale-fronted Toque Macaque” is not acceptable as a common name or distinguishing feature for this subspecies as all toque macaques have “pale fronts”, indeed, even Macaca radiata does as well. It is best to conserve the macaques’ natural habitat and allow natural reproduc tion to takeits course. Captive breeding, although probably easy, is not recom mended owed to the poor prospects for successful reintroduction into the wild. Resources are better spent protecting these animals and their natural habitat. Greater visibility of macaques near increasing numbers of tourists centers (hotels, concession stands, roadside fruit and vegetable stalls) is not an indicator of overall macaque population increase. Instead it reflects the dietary plasticity of the species and in many cases indicates a “last stand clinging to life” where natural forest habitat has been declined. Such macaque populations are also vulnerable to direct killing as pests."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,                 ,   ,   ,        ,"Up to 1,200m."                             ,                   ,         ,                        ,Endemic to Sri Lanka              ,          ,Declined by >50% in 3 generations and is predicted to decline by >10% in the next 10 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,                           ,Not known                                   ,                   ,                       ,                             ,"11.8 years, based on dry zone subspecies"                   ,"Lowland and midland tropical rain forest, wet zone lowland forests."                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,       ,                ,"Terrestrial, arboreal, diurnal, frugivore, insectivore"                                                                                                                                                    ,                                                                                                      ,              ,"Deforestation and habitat loss (large plantations and estates, that might have harbored some pock eted populations, are being reduced into smaller holdings unsuitable to support macaque groups or populations), shooting, snaring and poisoning as this animal is considered a pest.

Conserve the natural habitat and allow natural reproduction to take its course. Captive breeding although probably easy, is not recommended owed to the poor prospects for successful reintroduction into the wild.   Resources are better spent protecting these animals and their natural habitat. The IUCN criteria for “Critically Endangered” status is far too tight for a large terres trial mammal such as toque macaques. To qualify, such a taxon would need to be virtually extinct and beyond hope of salvation. Therefore, it is not a useful set of criteria for effective conservation action for this taxon. Given its very restricted and fragmented population, the M.s. opisthomelas subspecies should qualify for what it, in fact, is: “Critically Endangered”. This status would distinguish it from other “Endangered” Sri Lankan primates and might be used as a tool to obtain legal protection as well as conservation management action."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,                 ,   ,   ,        ,                                            ,                   ,         ,                        ,Endemic to Sri Lanka              ,          ,Declined by >80% in the past 200 years and predicted to decline by >10% in the next 10 years.

In addition, 80% of hill country forests were lost to tea plantations in the 19th century. There is a 1:1 relationship between loss of critical habitat and population number.

In the dry zone, humans choose to settle near permanent water that happens to be typical macaque forest habitat. Therefore, the dry zone subspecies is often found near rural human settlements.  The greater visibility of macaques near increasing numbers of tourist sites (hotels, concession stands, roadside fruit and vegetable stands) is not an indicator of overall macaque population increase.  Instead, it reflects the dietary plasticity of the species, and in many cases a last resource for survival where natural habitat has been destroyed. Such macaque populations are also very vulnerable to killing as pests. Captive breeding, although probably easy, is not recommended owed to the poor prospects for successful reintroduction into the wild. Resources are far better spent protecting these animals and their natural habitat.  Although this species is found in several NPs, their occurrence is confined to specific moist locations that are far less extensive in area than the total area of the NPs."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,                 ,   ,   ,        ,Up to 500m.                                 ,                   ,         ,                        ,Endemic to Sri Lanka              ,          ,Declined by >50% in 3 generations and is predicted to decline by >20% in the next 5 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,                           ,Not known                                   ,                   ,                       ,                             ,11.8 years                                                   ,Dry evergreen forest near water                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,       ,                ,"Diurnal, terrestrial, arboreal, frugivore, insectivore (requires access to free water)"                                                                                                                    ,                                                                                                      ,              ,"Mortality by poisoning and habitat loss.

Decline may not be as much on the whole. Protected areas are relatively safe.  Hunting pressure is very high in fringes. Areas like the proposed Megamalai Sanctuary, Gudrikkal range of Ranni division and New Amarambalam RF in Nilambur south division are fairly contiguous and a good population is still existing there but poaching and other biotic pressures may result in the decline of the population of more than 50% in the coming 30 years. These areas should be added into the PA network. Conversion of habitat outside PAs such as revenue lands, estates are serious threats to this species.  Upper Palni’s and New Amarambalam has to be declared as National Parks for the conservation of Nilgiri Langur among other animals. The EOO given is for Northern population and its extent of occurrence is decreasing. Gigi Joseph says that at the present condition the animal is not hunted for medicine in Kerala but the group has some difference of opinion on this point."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,                 ,   ,   ,        ,"300-2,000m."                               ,                   ,         ,                        ,Endemic to India                  ,          ,Declining by >10% in the last 10 years and is predicted to decline by <10% in the next 20 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,                           ,8300                                        ,                   ,                       ,                             ,Not known                                                    ,"Tropical wet evergreen, semi-evergreen, riparian forests, teak plantations"                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,       ,                ,"Arboreal, folivorous, diurnal, usually uni-male group."                                                                                                                                                    ,                                                                                                      ,              ,"Past threats: Crop plantations, mining, dams, fragmentation, traditional medicine

This subspecies is widely distributed in peninsular India cutting into the distribution of S. entellus achates from Disa in Gujarat through Nimar in Madhya Pradesh, Mahabaleswar and Wai in Maharashtra and Vijaynagar in Karnataka.  Its distribution in Andhra Pradesh is in the northern areas of the state, north of river Krishna and south of river Godavari all the way to the east coast.

From the Delhi Gazette of 2 March 1867, the “many thousands” of langurs in Krishnagar were all descendants from a single pair released “many years ago” by devotees.

Although there is a law to protect wildlife, implementation of the law is rare unless under extreme circumstances (e.g. commercial hunting from Ruhuna NP).  According to government data, during the last 42 years (1956-1993), the country has lost 50% of its forest cover, but the loss is greater than 50% if the habitat change is during the last 10 years (1994-2003) is included. There is a close relationship between the loss of critical habitat and population number.

Detailed survey on the current status and demographic trends of Golden Langur is essential. Trans-border exchange of information and research and management plan recommended. Due to localised distribution T. geei is confined only into a small patch of forest in India and Bhutan. In India they are restricted only to national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and secondary forests of degraded habitat in unclassified forests comprising only around 1000 km2, while in Bhutan, the estimated range is 1400 km2. Again in India the species pose severe pressure in the form of loss of habitat and needs special measures for conservation.   Hotspots like northeastern India (Eastern Himalaya) where the problems are very unique, a unique solution/ action plan is required to solve these problems.  So a broad, viable conservation is recommended to preserve their habitat.  In Bhutan, the population is secure as the habitat is still large and contiguous and no poaching or capture occur.
